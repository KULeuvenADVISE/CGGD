# Constraint Guided Gradient Descent: Guided Training with Inequality Constraints with Applications in Regression and Semantic Segmentation


The data sets should be placed in __../regression/DataSets__ with the same instructions as described in [README.md](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/blob/main/regression/DataSets/README.md). The preprocessing should be ran first as well.

The code in [__./ablation__](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/tree/main/regression-sup-semisup/ablation) can be used to rerun the ablation study.

The code in [__./comparison__](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/tree/main/regression-sup-semisup/comparison) can be used to rerun the experiments where the performance of CGGD is compared to an unconstrained baseline and a fuzzy approach.

There are only minor differences between the scripts in both directories. Therefore, only a detailed explanation is provided for the contents of the scripts in [__./comparison__](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/tree/main/regression-sup-semisup/comparison).
