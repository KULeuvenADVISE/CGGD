# Constraint Guided Gradient Descent: Guided Training with Inequality Constraints with Applications in Regression and Semantic Segmentation


This repository contains code to perform the ablation study of [2]. Please look at the [README.md file of the other regression experiment](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/blob/main/regression-sup-semisup/comparison/README.md) for the explanation on how to use the files in this directory. Only the differences are listed below.

The postprocessing can be done for each data set and experiment individually. The name of the file indicates the name of the experiment as well as the data set:
- __DiffSize__ means that the experiment for different sizes of training set is considered.
- __SemiSup__ means that different semi-supervised training sets are considered.
- __BC__ means that the Bias Correction data set is considered.
- __FI__ means that the Family Income data set is considered.
