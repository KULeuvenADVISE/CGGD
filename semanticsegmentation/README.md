# Constraint Guided Gradient Descent: Guided Training with Inequality Constraints with Applications in Regression and Semantic Segmentation

The files and instructions required to run the experiments on the Prostate data set are in [__./prostate__](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/blob/main/semanticsegmentation/prostate).

The files and instructions required to run the experiments on the toy data set are in [__./toy__](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/blob/main/semanticsegmentation/toy).

The MakeFiles are adjusted from the ones available at [Sizeloss_WSS](https://github.com/LIVIAETS/SizeLoss_WSS/tree/master) and [extended_logbarrier](https://github.com/LIVIAETS/extended_logbarrier/tree/master) and are not guaranteed to support the flexibility. The only use is to reproduce the experiments as described in **Insert link to section of Neurocomputing paper**.

The virtual environment used for this experiments is given by [__requirements-semanticsegmentation.yml__](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/blob/main/venv-requirements/requirements-semanticsegmentation.yml)
