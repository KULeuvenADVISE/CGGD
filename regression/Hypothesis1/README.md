Hypothesis 1
===

The code for running the experiment on the sample of the bias correction data set is put in the directory __./BiasCorrection__.

The code for running the experiment on the sample of the family income data set is put in the directory __./FamilyIncome__.

Each directory contains files with similar names. The function of the files are the same and are only discussed for the __BiasCorrection__ directory. The difference between the different files are the functions that compute the satisfaction of the constraints and define the constraints. All other functions are exactly the same for both datasets.

__Note__: make sure to download the data set and store it with the correct name (see [the instructions](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/blob/main/regression/README.md) for more details) and run [__preprocessing.py__](https://github.com/KULeuvenADVISE/CGGD/blob/main/regression/DataSets/dataPreprocessing.py).
